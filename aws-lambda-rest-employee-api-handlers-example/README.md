**BasicRestRequestHandlerLambda**
=============================

**Overview**
-----------

This is a Java-based AWS Lambda function that handles REST requests and returns a response with a timestamp and a welcome message.

**Functionality**
---------------

The lambda function takes an AWS API Gateway Proxy Request Event as input, parses the request body as a JSON object, and returns a response with a timestamp and a welcome message.

**Request Body**
-------------

The lambda function does not require a specific request body. Any JSON object can be sent as a request body.

**Response**
---------

The lambda function returns an API Gateway Proxy Response Event with a status code of 200, a timestamp in the headers, and a response body containing a welcome message.

Example:
```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "headers": {
    "timeStamp": "1643723400"
  },
  "body": "{\"responseMessage\":\"Hello World. Welcome to the first basic lambda.\"}"
}
```
**Error Handling**
----------------

If the request body is not a valid JSON object, the lambda function will log an error and return a 500 Internal Server Error response.

**Dependencies**
--------------

* AWS Lambda Java runtime
* AWS API Gateway
* org.json.simple library for JSON parsing

**Configuration**
---------------

* The lambda function should be configured to handle API Gateway Proxy Request Events.
* The lambda function should have the necessary execution role and permissions to write logs to CloudWatch.

**Testing**
---------

To test the lambda function, create an API Gateway REST API with a POST method that triggers this lambda function. Send a JSON request body to the API endpoint and verify that the response contains the welcome message and a timestamp.

**Note**
----

This lambda function is a basic example and does not perform any validation or error handling on the request body. In a production environment, you should add additional error handling and validation to ensure the lambda function behaves as expected.
